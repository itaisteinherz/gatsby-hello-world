# gatsby-hello-world

Basic Gatsby blog based on [gatsby-starter-hello-world](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world) and [_Build a Blog with React and Markdown using Gatsby_](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-blog-with-react-and-markdown-using-gatsby).

_**Note:** I experienced some issues when compiling the website after following [_Build Gatsby Page Slugs Dynamically from Markdown with gatsby-node.js_](https://egghead.io/lessons/gatsby-build-gatsby-page-slugs-dynamically-from-markdown-with-gatsby-node-js), and (based on Cristian Gabbanini's comment) used parts of [the Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-markdown-pages/#create-static-pages-using-gatsbys-node-api) to make things work as expected._
